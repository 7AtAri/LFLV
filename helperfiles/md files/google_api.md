Here's what you need to do:

    Enable the APIs: In your Google Cloud project, make sure that both the Street View API and the Directions API are enabled. You can do this in the Google Cloud Console under the "APIs & Services" dashboard.

    Restrict and Secure Your Key: While using the same API key for multiple services is convenient, it's important to secure your key. You can apply restrictions, like limiting the key to certain services (e.g., only Maps-related APIs) or to specific web domains or IP addresses.

    Billing Account: Ensure that your billing account is set up correctly, as both the Street View and Directions APIs are part of Google's paid services. The usage of these APIs is charged separately, so you'll need to be aware of the cost associated with each API call.

    Use the Same Key in Your Code: In your Python script, you can use the same API_KEY variable for accessing both the Street View and Directions APIs. Just make sure that this key has permissions for both services.

By using a single API key, you simplify the management of your Google Cloud services, but always be mindful of the security and cost implications.
