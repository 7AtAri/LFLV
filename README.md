# Learning from Las Vegas

## General Idea
This project tries to examine the visual vocabulary 
a neural networks learned with respect to urban architecture.

In the famous book "learning from las vegas" from 1972 by 
Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour,
a visual vocabulary for Las Vegas is documented manually by domain experts.

## Data
1) Publicly available images of the city of Las Vegas will be
collected with webscaping.
possible datasources: 
- google street view
- google image search
- ...

2) the data / parts of the data (maybe only for testing?) might need to be tagged manually

## Transfer Learning

A (state-of-the-art) pretrained neural network will be fine-tuned on the Las Vegas Images.

-> classification ?
-> conditional image generation?

## Evaluation

- measure feature vector distances
- visualize with r-tsne
- visualize neurons for architectural features
